## Adding projects

Once you create your project you can edit it at any time, and no one will see it until you are ready to share it with your staff or network partners. 

# What you will need to create your project

1.	Basic details like name of project, address, completion date, a short description etc
2.	A price list in a table format, you will be able to copy and paste it straight in from excel!
3.	Any images and documents you would like available (eg floorplans, contracts, brochures etc)

# 1. Create the project

Start by clicking the Create Project Button, from there you will need to select if it is an Apartment Development of a House and Land development.

# Adding projects

Once you create your project you can edit it at any time, and no one will see it until you are ready to share it with your staff or network partners. 

### What you will need to create your project

1.	Basic details like name of project, address, completion date, a short description etc
2.	A price list in a table format, you will be able to copy and paste it straight in from excel!
3.	Any images and documents you would like available (eg floorplans, contracts, brochures etc)

### 1. Create the project

Start by clicking the Create Project Button, from there you will need to select if it is an Apartment Development of a House and Land development.

### 2. Enter basic details

Enter Project Details - note most fields are optional but the more complete the easier it will for your sales network to find the information.

* Project name
* Project address
* Project description/marketing blurb 
* Video URL (only if available)
* Carpark value (only if required)
* Estimated start and completion dated
* Sunset Clause
* Total Units
* Number of Levels
* Builder
* Vendor

### 3. Setting up reservation details

![reservation](http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1443673687/HelpGuide/2015-10-01_14-26-50.png)

This is where you can customise how your networks can reserve properties

1.	If you require a reservation fee to be paid in order for an agent to reserve a property you will need to select the require payment box – the system enables the agent to make a refundable reservation fee payment by Credit Card

2.	You will need to set the reservation fee amount, this amount will ultimately be returned to the buyer and will not form part of the deposit, the platform does not currently handle deposit payments, that is between the developer and the buyer


3.	You will need to set the reservation fee period, which is the amount of time you give the agent to pay the reservation fee.  

4.	If you want to manually approve all reservations then this box should be ticked, this can slow down the process and lead to more than one agent attempting to reserve the same property because the reservation is waiting on approval.  Usually this is only used if you don’t have exclusivity over the project


5.	If you would like reservations which are unpaid within the time frame you have set to be automatically cancelled and made available to reserve again then you need to select the automatic reservation cancellation tick box.  Tip: if you are selecting this make sure you give your agents enough time to make the payment!

6.	The default commission settings are simply to set up a default commission for each project which is useful to help you keep track of your commissions in the commissions section.  This is not published and none of your agents will ever see this field.

7.	The contract, deposit and settlement due is where you can set the number of days after the reservation you would require the buyer to progress the purchase, these dates are optional to enter but will help with the reservation workflow and will help your agents know when everything is due. 

8.	In the reservation agreement all the legal T&Cs and privacy matters are covered but if you have specific reservation instructions for your agents that you want to call our or make obvious you can enter them in the Reservation Instructions section.

### 4. Import your pricelist

You will be prompted to import a price list, but if you aren’t ready to do so just yet, you can always find it in the small cog that allows you to edit your project.

![pricelist-paste](http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1443680958/HelpGuide/2015-10-01_16-28-35.png)

Copy and paste your price list from Excel. Yes, it's that easy!

It is OK if your headings are unique, you will have a chance to match them after you import.

The minimum you require is the property number, the price, and the number of bedrooms.   Below is a complete list of all the fields that you are able to import per property.

* Property Number
* Property Name
* Level
* Property Type
* Price
* Status (sold/reserved/available/held)
* Internal Area (m²)
* External Area (m²)
* Total Area (m²)
* No. of bedrooms 
* No. of bathrooms 
* No. of car spaces
* Has Study?
* Property Style
* Aspect
* Estimated Stamp Duty Amount ($)
* Owner’s Corp Rates ($)
* Estimated Rental Value ($ per week)
* Additional Features

*When you have pasted from excel click the next button at the bottom of the page*

![field-match]( http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1443681795/HelpGuide/2015-10-01_16-38-01.png
)

Next you have the opportunity to select the corresponding fields if the system wasn’t able to identify it for you, you can also elect not to import some of the fields.

You will be informed if there are any issues with your import and allowed to fix it.  Common issues are things like having words where numbers are expected, or having blanks, eg if you are importing status it can’t be blank, it must either be available, reserved, sold, under contract, held.

### 5. Adding Documents and Images

Once you’ve imported your properties you probably want to add documents or images

![edit-project]( http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1444101413/HelpGuide/2015-10-06_14-16-00.png
)

You can edit your project, including import pricelist and change all settings by clicking on edit project which can be found in the small gear on the right of the page - where ever you see the little gear allows you to edit or take further action.

![edit-project]( http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1444101815/HelpGuide/2015-10-06_14-23-13.png)

Click on the documents or images tab and upload documents and images you would like to provide to your agents.  You are able to reorder and rename whatever you have uploaded.

You have the opportunity to tag the documents you have uploaded.  If you tag the floor plans to the corresponding property it means that that specific floor plan will be associated with the correct property so it is obvious which property has which floor plan.  Tagging is an efficient way of organising your documents to make it easy for your agents and staff to find what they are looking for.  

Common documents uploaded are things like contract of sale, brochures, floor plans and floor plates, other analysis or marketing materials. 

### 6. Publishing your project

![publish]( http://res.cloudinary.com/propconnect/image/upload/c_scale,w_628/v1444105053/HelpGuide/2015-10-06_15-17-24.png
)

The final step is to move your project from Pending to Active – active means you are able to share it with agents and they are able to reserve.

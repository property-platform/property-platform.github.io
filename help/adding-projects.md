# Adding projects

Once you create your project you can edit it at any time, and no one will see it until you are ready to share it with your staff or network partners. 

#### What you will need to create your project

1.	Basic details like name of project, address, completion date, a short description etc
2.	A price list in a table format, you will be able to copy and paste it straight in from excel!
3.	Any images and documents you would like available (eg floorplans, contracts, brochures etc)

#### 1. Create the project

Start by clicking the Create Project Button, from there you will need to select if it is an Apartment Development of a House and Land development.

This is where you can customise how your networks can reserve properties

1.	If you require a reservation fee to be paid in order for an agent to reserve a property you will need to select the require payment box – the system enables the agent to make a refundable reservation fee payment by Credit Card

2.	You will need to set the reservation fee amount, this amount will ultimately be returned to the buyer and will not form part of the deposit, the platform does not currently handle deposit payments, that is between the developer and the buyer


3.	You will need to set the reservation fee period, which is the amount of time you give the agent to pay the reservation fee.  

4.	If you want to manually approve all reservations then this box should be ticked, this can slow down the process and lead to more than one agent attempting to reserve the same property because the reservation is waiting on approval.  Usually this is only used if you don’t have exclusivity over the project


5.	If you would like reservations which are unpaid within the time frame you have set to be automatically cancelled and made available to reserve again then you need to select the automatic reservation cancellation tick box.  Tip: if you are selecting this make sure you give your agents enough time to make the payment!

6.	The default commission settings are simply to set up a default commission for each project which is useful to help you keep track of your commissions in the commissions section.  This is not published and none of your agents will ever see this field.

7.	The contract, deposit and settlement due is where you can set the number of days after the reservation you would require the buyer to progress the purchase, these dates are optional to enter but will help with the reservation workflow and will help your agents know when everything is due. 

8.	In the reservation agreement all the legal T&Cs and privacy matters are covered but if you have specific reservation instructions for your agents that you want to call our or make obvious you can enter them in the Reservation Instructions section.
